# About Me

### Introduction

> My name is Abhi, I am a second year CS major in ERC. In my free time I like to watch movies, watch sports, and hang out with friends. My favorite sports team is [Liverpool FC](https://www.liverpoolfc.com/). 
Some of my favorite movies are:
* The Batman
* Star Wars: The Revenge of the Sith
* Dune 2

**Me as a programmer**

So far, I have mainly used Python, Java, and C++. Below is an example of how to print "Hello World" in C++, Java, and Python respectively:

```
std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
System.out.println("Hello, World!");
print("Hello, World!")
```
